- 👋 Hi there! I'm Icaro Targino, a passionate software developer with a deep affinity for Java and the Spring framework. Since 2018, I've been immersing myself in this technology, constantly exploring ways to enhance my skills and deliver efficient, clean, and well-architected code.

- 🚀 My recent journey into the world of Golang has been thrilling! I'm fascinated by its capabilities and am eagerly incorporating it into my skill set. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and currently, I'm diving into the realms of clean code practices, computer architecture, DevOps, design patterns, Docker, and Kubernetes.

- 💪 Outside the digital world, I'm a fitness enthusiast who loves hitting the gym and running along the beach. Family gatherings are my happy place, and I cherish spending quality time with my loved ones. I'm also a hands-on DIYer, especially when it comes to woodworking, construction, and repairs. As a die-hard Flamengo fan, soccer is more than just a game to me - it's a passion.

- ❤️ I hold a special place in my heart for teaching programming. Sharing knowledge and helping others grow in this field is incredibly rewarding for me.

- 🌟 I'm keen on collaborating on projects involving Go and Java. If you're looking for someone committed to developing tools that make a difference, I'm your guy!

- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at icarotargino@onmail.com for collaborations, discussions, or just a friendly chat about technology and life!
